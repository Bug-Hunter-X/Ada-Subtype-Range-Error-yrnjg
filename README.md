This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming involving subtype ranges.  The variable X is defined with a subtype that restricts its range to 1..10. However, the code later attempts to increase X beyond this range, leading to a potential runtime error.  The solution illustrates how to prevent this error by adding checks to ensure that the variable always remains within its defined range.
